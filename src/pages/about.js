                            <p><em>Bio: in my own words (see <a href="#bio-short-version">bonus short version, below</a>)</em></p>
                            <p>I am the Head of Learning at Gatsby.js, a remote startup creating fast, accessible websites and apps while building a strong community. My prior roles were Developer Advocate and Senior Front-End Engineer at <a href="https://www.deque.com">Deque Systems</a>, where I worked on the <a href="https://www.deque.com/products/axe/">axe-core</a> team focusing on accessibility test integrations into web developer tooling. I'm passionate about improving the web for people with disabilities and I often go to conferences to speak about it. My blog, <a href="http://a11ywins.tumblr.com">Accessibility Wins</a>, highlights accessible user interfaces and tools, contributing a positive voice to the web development space. In 2016, O'Reilly presented me with a Web Platform Award for my work in accessibility. I'm a co-leader of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/a11ysea/">Accessibility Seattle Meetup</a>, and I recently founded a social/volunteering group in my city of Bellingham called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NW-Tech-Women/">NW Tech Women</a>.</p>

                            <p>My education includes a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Journalism from Brooks Institute of Photography and an Associate of Applied Arts in Web Design &#038; Multimedia from the Art Institute of Seattle. I became very interested in web development during college, creating HTML websites for photo documentary classes and later, interactive Flash websites. I naturally went back to HTML &amp; CSS, with Ecmascript experience that helped me fall in love with JavaScript. When I learned about Web Accessibility, I liked that it reflected my values and added meaning to my work. I love solving problems with design and code when they have potential to help as many people as possible.</p>

                            <p>I&#8217;m inspired by nature, street art, typography and music and I try to appreciate life's ups and downs. I&#8217;m also pretty hooked on <a href="https://instagram.com/marcysutton" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Link opens in a new window">riding my bike</a> outside.</p>
